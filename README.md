# üè• Predictive Analytics for Hospital Readmissions  
**üìä Machine Learning for Healthcare Outcome Optimization**

This project focuses on predicting hospital readmissions using patient and encounter-level data. By applying machine learning models to healthcare datasets, hospitals can identify high-risk patients, reduce readmission rates, and improve care efficiency. The pipeline includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## üìå Problem Statement  
Hospitals face financial and reputational challenges due to unplanned readmissions. The ability to predict which patients are likely to be readmitted enables better patient care planning and targeted interventions. This project leverages real-world healthcare datasets to build models that can anticipate readmissions.

---

## üéØ Objective  
- Predict 30-day hospital readmission risks using clinical data  
- Apply traditional ML models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost  
- Build a complete ML pipeline from preprocessing to evaluation  
- Generate performance reports and visualizations for stakeholder understanding

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges  
- Handling class imbalance in readmission data  
- Managing missing values and inconsistent categorical data  
- Encoding clinical terms and diagnosis codes meaningfully  
- Evaluating model generalizability on unseen patient data

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Lifecycle  
1. **Data Collection**  
   - Public healthcare datasets from CMS and Kaggle (Diabetes Readmission)  
2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Cleaning, encoding, imputing, and scaling patient data  
3. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Creating new features like total visits, age groups, chronic condition flags  
4. **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**  
   - Visualizing patient distributions, correlation maps, trends across age/diagnosis  
5. **Model Building**  
   - Training Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost classifiers  
6. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Classification reports, ROC-AUC, F1 Score, confusion matrices  
7. **Reporting & Dashboard (Optional)**  
   - Visual output via Plotly/Seaborn and interactive dashboard with Streamlit
