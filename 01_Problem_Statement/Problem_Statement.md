## 📌 Problem Statement  
Hospitals face financial and reputational challenges due to unplanned readmissions. The ability to predict which patients are likely to be readmitted enables better patient care planning and targeted interventions. This project leverages real-world healthcare datasets to build models that can anticipate readmissions.

---

## 🎯 Objective  
- Predict 30-day hospital readmission risks using clinical data  
- Apply traditional ML models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost  
- Build a complete ML pipeline from preprocessing to evaluation  
- Generate performance reports and visualizations for stakeholder understanding

---

## ⚠️ Challenges  
- Handling class imbalance in readmission data  
- Managing missing values and inconsistent categorical data  
- Encoding clinical terms and diagnosis codes meaningfully  
- Evaluating model generalizability on unseen patient data
