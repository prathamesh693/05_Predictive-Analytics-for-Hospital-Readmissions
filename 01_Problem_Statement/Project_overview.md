## üõ†Ô∏è Project Lifecycle  
1. **Data Collection**  
   - Public healthcare datasets from CMS and Kaggle (Diabetes Readmission)  
2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Cleaning, encoding, imputing, and scaling patient data  
3. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Creating new features like total visits, age groups, chronic condition flags  
4. **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**  
   - Visualizing patient distributions, correlation maps, trends across age/diagnosis  
5. **Model Building**  
   - Training Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost classifiers  
6. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Classification reports, ROC-AUC, F1 Score, confusion matrices  
7. **Reporting & Dashboard (Optional)**  
   - Visual output via Plotly/Seaborn and interactive dashboard with Streamlit
